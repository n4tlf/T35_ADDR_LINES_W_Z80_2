WARNING(1): s100_sMEMR has no assigned placement; it will be placed randomly.
1 IOs will have random placement.
WARNING(2): Clock driver, pll0_2MHz, should not directly drive output pad, s100_clock, in the core. Use the 'clkout' mode in GPIO instead.
WARNING(3): Clock input pad, pll0_2MHz, of net, s100_clock, drives both clock buffer and logic. Expect extra clock skew.
